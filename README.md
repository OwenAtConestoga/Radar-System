# Real-Time Radar Detection System

An Arduino-based radar system designed to detect and map objects in real time using a servo motor and ultrasonic sensor. The system processes data dynamically and visually displays object distances and angles on a radar-like interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detects and measures the distance of objects in front of the radar system.
- **Dynamic Scanning**: Mounted on a servo motor, the radar scans back and forth to cover a range of angles.
- **Customizable Design**: Built with modular hardware and software components for easy adaptation to other projects.

## How It Works

1. **Servo Motor Scanning**:  
   - The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a servo motor.
   - The servo moves incrementally in a predefined angular range (e.g., 0° to 180°) to scan the environment.

2. **Distance Measurement**:  
   - The ultrasonic sensor sends out sound waves and calculates the distance to objects by measuring the time taken for the waves to return.

3. **Data Processing**:  
   - The data is processed in real-time by the Arduino, converting distance measurements into positional information.

## Hardware Components

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno or Nano) for controlling the system.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: HC-SR04 or similar for distance measurement.
- **Servo Motor**: For rotating the ultrasonic sensor to scan the environment.
- **Wires and Connectors**: To assemble and power the components.
- **Optional**: Breadboard or PCB for wiring, and a mount for stabilizing the components.

## Software Components

- **Arduino Code**: Handles servo motor control, ultrasonic sensor readings, and serial communication.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Hardware Assembly**:
   - Attach the ultrasonic sensor to the servo motor.
   - Mount the servo motor to a stable base.
   - Connect the components to the Arduino according to the wiring diagram (to be updated).

2. **Upload Code**:
   - Write or load the Arduino sketch for servo control and ultrasonic readings.
   - Upload the sketch to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Run Visualization**:
   - Ensure the Arduino is connected via USB and configured for serial communication.

## Usage

1. Power on the Arduino and connected components.
2. The servo motor will start scanning the specified angular range.
3. Observe the radar display on your computer as objects are detected in real-time.

## Future Enhancements

- Add adjustable scanning range and speed.
- Implement object tracking capabilities for moving objects.
- Improve visualization with 3D radar or heatmap-style interfaces.
- Expand functionality to detect object shapes or sizes.
